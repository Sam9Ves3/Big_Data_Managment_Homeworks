According to the talk by Paco Ocampo, in Google Cloud there are 8 types of databases:  Relational,  Key-Value,  Document,  In-memory,  Graph,  Search,  Time-series and Ledger.  According to wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL), you can split key-value in four types: Cache, store, store eventually consistent and store ordered. Also there are tuple-store, wide-column store and native multi-model databases.

Your work consist in two parts: 

First make a concise description of the type of databases you are researching (you can improve the content of pages such as https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-comparison-of-nosql-database-management-systems-and-models or https://www.accionlabs.com/articles/2018/4/9/choosing-a-nosql-database-technology-comparison-matrix). 

Second you must make a matrix of the family of databases according to the  scope like the page https://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/nosql-databases-solution-cassandra-mongodb-couchdb

You must send the link (not a txt file, not a docx) to a document in markdown hosted in github.

## Graph, In-memory, Search
